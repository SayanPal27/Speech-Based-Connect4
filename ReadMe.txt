Brief Summary of the project and what the code intends to do:

This project intends to detect the digit uttered by the speaker based on the speech recordings given by speaker.

Here is the basic flow of how the data is processed and results are generated.

1. 30 recordings each for the 10 digits have been recorded and saved as text files and wav files using the Cool Edit 2000 software.
   
   Sample rate : 16000
   Channel : Mono
   Resolution : 16 bit

   20 recordings are used for training and 10 recordings are used for testing for each of the digits
   
For the 20*10 training recordings, we follow the below procedure:
2. Universe is generated by using LPC method.
3. Codebook is generated for this universe using the LBG Algorithm.
4. The solutions to the 3 HMM problems are used to create models for each of the 9 digits.
5. The models are stored to be used for testing.

For the 10*10 test recordings , we follow the below procedure:
6. Observation Sequence is generated for the speech file.
7. Solution to evaluation problem is used to find the probabilities that each of the model has given the observation sequence.
11. The digit with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted digit.
12. The Accuracy is calculated and displayed.

2. Complile/Build the code and Click on Run/ Press F5 alternately.
3. A console window will open up and the results of the various tests will be displayed.
4. Press any key to exit the console.

AppWizard has created this 234101048_digitrecognition application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your 234101048_digitrecognition application.


234101048_digitrecognition.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

234101048_digitrecognition.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

234101048_digitrecognition.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named 234101048_digitrecognition.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
